## 🧠 What Is Skyline?

Skyline is a web app for buying dreams (aka viewing properties). It lets users:
- Browse beautiful buildings,
- Like the ones they’ll never afford,
- Make reservations to pretend they might someday.

Meanwhile:
- **Agents** manage their listings like real professionals.
- **Admins**... well, they run the world (of this app).

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

Follow along and you’ll have a real estate site running in no time. Or 5 minutes. Depends on your Wi-Fi.

### 1. Clone the Repo

### 2. Configure the backend
cd back-end
npm install
npm start

Before running it, make sure you create a .env file in /back-end with your secrets (don’t worry, we won’t tell anyone).

Then open emailService.js and configure your Nodemailer transporter properly. Yes, we left you something to do.
PS: If your emails don’t send, blame Google’s SMTP settings. Then fix it.
